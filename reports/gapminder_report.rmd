This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read-data}

```{r gdp -lifeExp-1997-plot}

ggplot(gapminder_1997) +
  (aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +

  labs(x= "GDP", y = "LifeExp (in years)", title = "Comparing GDP versus Life Expectancy")
